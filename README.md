## Objective
This project analyzes the simplified version of the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Repository. The data comes from telephone-based direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank, and the goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (binary variable *y*). Econometric models (Logit/Probit) and machine learning methods (Decision Tree and Random Forest) are implemented and compared. 

This work is part of the FIN214 – Financial Econometrics course. Assignment instructions are omitted.
